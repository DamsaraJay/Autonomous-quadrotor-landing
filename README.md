In this project, an algorithm for autonomus quadrotor landing using MPC is presented. The objective is to land the quadrotor onto a target marked by an Aruco marker.
This algorithm is implemented in hardware using a Raspberry PI, a camera for marker detection an a pixhawk controller. The control algorithm is explained in the presentation attached.
